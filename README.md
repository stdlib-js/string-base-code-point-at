## Usage

```javascript
import codePointAt from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-code-point-at@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/string-base-code-point-at/tags). For example,

```javascript
import codePointAt from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-code-point-at@v0.0.1-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### codePointAt( string, position, backward )

Returns a Unicode [code point][code-point] from a string at a specified position.

```javascript
var out = codePointAt( 'last man standing', 4, false );
// returns 32
```

The function supports a `backward` argument for performing backward iteration for low surrogates.

```javascript
var out = codePointAt( 'üå∑', 1, true );
// returns 127799
```

The function supports providing a negative `position`.

```javascript
var out = codePointAt( 'last man standing', -13, false );
// returns 32
```

## Notes

This function differs from [`String.prototype.codePointAt`][mdn-string-codepointat] in the following ways:

-   The function supports providing a negative `position`. If provided a negative `position`, the function determines the string position relative to the end of the string.
-   The function supports a `backward` argument for performing backward iteration for low surrogates. [`String.prototype.codePointAt`][mdn-string-codepointat] simply returns the low surrogate value if no [UTF-16][utf-16] surrogate pair begins at the specified position. If invoked with `backward` set to `true`, this function will return the code point after aggregating with the preceding high surrogate, if the specified position does not mark the start of a surrogate pair.
